## 1. Overview

Each tag represents a **configuration baseline** at a specific point in the project life cycle.  
Tags are applied at the end of each sprint and correspond to stable, reviewed builds that passed all QA and coverage requirements.

**Tag format:**  
`v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`  
- **Major** – major milestone or final release  
- **Minor** – sprint-level release  
- **Patch** – hotfix or minor adjustment
